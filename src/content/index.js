export const About_Context = `Born and raised in the vibrant city of Hong Kong, I’ve always been driven by curiosity and creativity. Though I initially studied advertising and marketing management, my passion for design, filmmaking, and programming took over. I taught myself these skills and turned them into a career, helping businesses bring their creative and digital visions to life. Eventually, I moved to Toronto to start a new chapter and immerse myself in the tech world. When I’m not coding or designing, I’m reflecting on my travels, editing footage, and planning my next adventure, always seeking new ways to evolve my craft.`;
